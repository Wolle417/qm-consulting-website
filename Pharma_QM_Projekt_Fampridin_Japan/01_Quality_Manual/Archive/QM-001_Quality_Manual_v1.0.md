- Implement containment measures

**Step 3: Investigation**
- Root Cause Analysis (5-Why, Fishbone, Fault Tree)
- Assess impact on product quality
- Determine if other batches affected

**Step 4: Corrective Action (CA)**
- Action to fix the specific problem

**Step 5: Preventive Action (PA)**
- Action to prevent recurrence

**Step 6: CAPA Implementation**
- Assign responsibilities and deadlines
- Implement actions
- Verify effectiveness

**Step 7: Closure**
- QA approval after effectiveness check
- Typical timeline: 30-60 days

---

### 12.3 CAPA (CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTION)

**Purpose:** Systematic approach to prevent recurrence of problems

**Triggers:**
- Deviations
- Out-of-Specification results
- Audit findings
- Customer complaints
- Trends indicating systemic issues

**CAPA Process:**
1. **Problem Definition:** What happened?
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Why did it happen?
3. **Corrective Action:** Fix this instance
4. **Preventive Action:** Prevent future occurrences (e.g., SOP revision, training, equipment modification)
5. **Implementation:** Execute actions
6. **Effectiveness Check:** After 3-6 months, verify actions were effective (problem has not recurred)

**Documentation:**
- CAPA form with all details
- Root cause analysis documentation (e.g., 5-Why chart)
- Evidence of action completion (e.g., revised SOP, training records)
- Effectiveness check results

**Metrics:**
- Number of open CAPAs
- Average time to closure
- Recurrence rate
