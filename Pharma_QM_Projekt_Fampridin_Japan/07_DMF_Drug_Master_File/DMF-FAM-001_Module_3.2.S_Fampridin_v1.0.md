### 3.2.S.7.3 STABILITY DATA

**Summary of Stability Results:**

**LONG-TERM STABILITY (25°C / 60% RH) – Batch 2024-01-001**

| Time Point | Appearance | Assay (%) | Total Impurities (%) | Water (%) | Conclusion |
|------------|------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------|------------|
| Initial (T=0) | Conforms | 99.8 | 0.32 | 0.25 | Pass |
| 3 months | Conforms | 99.7 | 0.33 | 0.26 | Pass |
| 6 months | Conforms | 99.7 | 0.34 | 0.28 | Pass |
| 9 months | Conforms | 99.6 | 0.35 | 0.29 | Pass |
| 12 months | Conforms | 99.6 | 0.36 | 0.30 | Pass |
| 18 months | Conforms | 99.5 | 0.38 | 0.32 | Pass |
| 24 months | Conforms | 99.5 | 0.40 | 0.33 | Pass |

**Trend:** Slight increase in impurities and water content over time, but all within specification limits.

**ACCELERATED STABILITY (40°C / 75% RH) – Batch 2024-01-001**

| Time Point | Appearance | Assay (%) | Total Impurities (%) | Water (%) | Conclusion |
|------------|------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------|------------|
| Initial (T=0) | Conforms | 99.8 | 0.32 | 0.25 | Pass |
| 1 month | Conforms | 99.7 | 0.34 | 0.28 | Pass |
| 3 months | Conforms | 99.6 | 0.38 | 0.32 | Pass |
| 6 months | Conforms | 99.5 | 0.42 | 0.36 | Pass |

**Conclusion:** No significant change observed under accelerated conditions. All parameters within specification.

### 3.2.S.7.4 PROPOSED RETEST DATE / EXPIRY DATE

**Based on stability data:**

**Proposed Retest Period:** **36 months**

**Storage Conditions:** Store at 15-25°C, protect from light and moisture

**Justification:**
- Long-term stability data (24 months) shows no significant degradation
- Accelerated stability data (6 months) shows product is stable
- Extrapolation to 36 months is justified per ICH Q1E guidelines
- Ongoing stability studies will continue to support retest period

**Label Storage Statement:** "Store at 15-25°C. Protect from light and moisture. Retest date: [36 months from manufacture date]"
